# DevOps Interview
## 1. If you want to only keep 5 commits from the DEV branch and discard the other 45 how you can  do
To keep only the last 5 commits from the DEV branch and discard the other 45, you can use the `git reset` and `git push --force` commands. Here's how:

1. Make sure you are on the DEV branch: `git checkout DEV`

2. Use `git log` to identify the commit ID of the fifth commit from the end that you want to keep. Note down the commit ID.

3. Use `git reset --hard <commit ID>` to reset the branch to the commit you identified in step 2. This will discard all the other commits.

4. Use `git push --force` to push the changes to the remote repository. Note that this will overwrite the existing DEV branch on the remote repository, so make sure you have permission to do so and that you communicate with your team members about the changes you're making.

After completing these steps, the DEV branch will only contain the last 5 commits. Any other commits that were previously on the branch will be discarded.

## 2. If you have a Maven Spring Boot application installed on an EC2 instance and you want to automate tasks such as deployment, testing, and monitoring how you done with Aws
To automate tasks such as deployment, testing, and monitoring of a Maven Spring Boot application running on an EC2 instance, you can use a variety of AWS services. Here is a general approach that can be used:

1. Deployment: Use AWS CodeDeploy to automate the deployment of the Maven Spring Boot application to the EC2 instance. CodeDeploy can be used to deploy the application to a variety of target environments, such as EC2 instances, AWS Lambda functions, or even on-premise servers.

2. Testing: Set up automated testing using a service like AWS CodePipeline or AWS CodeBuild. Automated testing can help ensure that code changes do not introduce new bugs or regressions. You can also use AWS Device Farm to test your application on real devices.

3. Monitoring: Use a monitoring service such as AWS CloudWatch to monitor the performance of the application in production. CloudWatch can be used to collect and analyze metrics, set up alarms, and create dashboards. You can also use AWS X-Ray to trace requests across microservices and see the performance of your application.

4. Scaling: Use AWS Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances running your application based on demand. You can also use AWS Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic across multiple instances and ensure high availability.

5. Logging: Use AWS CloudWatch Logs to aggregate and analyze logs from your application. You can also use AWS Kinesis Data Firehose to stream logs to other services like Amazon S3 or Elasticsearch.

By using these AWS services, you can automate tasks such as deployment, testing, and monitoring of your Maven Spring Boot application running on an EC2 instance, and ensure that your application is highly available and performing optimally.

## 3. How To display error logs for a Java application running on an EC2 instance?
To display error logs for a Java application running on an EC2 instance, you can follow these steps:

1. SSH into the EC2 instance where the Java application is running.

2. Navigate to the directory where the Java application is installed.

3. Locate the log file for the application. The log file may be located in a subdirectory of the application directory or in a specific directory for logs.

4. Use a command-line text editor, such as vi or nano, to open the log file. For example, if the log file is named "app.log", you can use the command "nano app.log" to open it in the nano editor.

5. Search for any error messages in the log file. Errors are typically identified by a specific level or keyword, such as "ERROR" or "Exception".

6. Analyze the error messages to determine the root cause of any issues with the Java application.

7. If necessary, take corrective action to address any issues identified in the log file.

It is also possible to configure the Java application to output logs to a specific file or to a remote logging service, such as AWS CloudWatch Logs. By doing this, you can view logs for the application without having to SSH into the EC2 instance.

To display error logs for a Java application running on an EC2 instance, you can use various tools depending on the log format and preferences. Here is a general approach that can be used:

1. SSH into the EC2 instance: Use an SSH client to connect to the EC2 instance running the Java application. 

2. Navigate to the log directory: Typically, Java applications store their logs in a specific directory or file. Navigate to the log directory using the "cd" command.

3. View logs with tail command: Use the "tail" command to view the last few lines of the log file. For example, you can use "tail -f logfile.txt" to display the contents of the logfile.txt file as it is being written. This can be useful for monitoring logs in real-time.

4. Use a log viewer tool: If the logs are in a different format or if you prefer a graphical interface, you can use a log viewer tool. There are several tools available for viewing logs, such as Loggly, ELK stack, or AWS CloudWatch Logs. These tools can be used to aggregate and analyze logs across multiple EC2 instances, and can provide advanced features like search, filtering, and alerts.

5. Check Java application logs: Many Java applications also provide their own logging framework, such as Log4j or Logback. Check the application's documentation to see how to configure and view application logs.

By using these tools and techniques, you can quickly and efficiently view error logs for Java applications running on EC2 instances.
